# [browser_image_support](https://ajeetgill.github.io/browser_image_support/)
## Issue
Was working on a freelance project in which to optimize images I used .webp images but client's browser didn't support these images. 
It was remote so to narrow down probable issues - I built this repo (hosted using github pages) to understand what the issue was.
Asking Clients if their browser supports webp(& other) formats doesn't help.

## Cause
Mostly when the user hasn't updated their device in a long time (common with non-tech people)

## Tech-stack
HTML, CSS, JS (brushing-up my core skills)
